## Project Objectives
In Project 2, my goal is to implement a web solution similar to Project 1 but with a twist – I will be switching to NGINX as our web server. NGINX is renowned and embraced by numerous websites across the internet.

## Step 0 – Preparing prerequisites

To complete this project I will need an AWS account and a virtual server with Ubuntu Server OS.
